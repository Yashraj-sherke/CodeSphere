# 🌐 CodeSphere – Your Universe of Coding Opportunities

## 🧠 How the Idea Arose

In today’s tech world, opportunities like coding contests, hackathons, and hiring challenges are spread across multiple platforms—making it hard to track, prepare, and participate efficiently. 

As developers, we often:
- Miss contests due to scattered platforms (Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.)
- Discover hackathons too late
- Struggle to find hiring challenges in one place
- Lack a dynamic resume that showcases our participations

**CodeSphere** solves this problem by becoming a single platform where all these opportunities orbit together.
